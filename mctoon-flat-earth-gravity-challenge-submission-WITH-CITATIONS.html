    <h2>The Acceleration of Falling Objects in Relationship to the Atmospheric Pressure and Molecular Density of an Enclosed Pressurized System According to The Second Law of Thermodynamics</h2>
    <div class="cited">
      <h3>Speeding up While Falling Down</h3>
      <p>Heliocentrists claim that Gravity is a force that pulls objects down toward the ground. Additionally, when objects fall to the ground, they assert that Gravity causes them to accelerate. Acceleration is a change in velocity, and velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion. The idea is that Gravity causes an object to fall toward the ground at a faster and faster velocity the longer the object falls. An object falls at 9.8 m/s2.
      <p>By 1 second after an object starts falling, its velocity is 9.8 m/s2.
      <p>By 2 seconds after it starts falling, its velocity is 19.6 m/s (9.8 m/s + 9.8 m/s).

    <p>By 3 seconds after it starts falling, its velocity is 29.4 m/s (9.8 m/s + 9.8 m/s + 9.8 m/s).
    <p>By 4 seconds after it starts falling, its velocity is 39.2 m/s (9.8 m/s + 9.8 m/s + 9.8 m/s+ 9.8 m/s).
    <p>By 5 seconds after it starts falling, its velocity is 49.0 m/s (9.8 m/s + 9.8 m/s + 9.8 m/s+ 9.8 m/s+ 9.8 m/s).
    <h3>Terminal Velocity</h3>
    <p>Falling objects eventually reach a maximum speed, which is called "Terminal Velocity", when falling, even though, theoretically, in a vacuum an object would continually accelerate in its free fall. Yet, due to atmospheric pressure, falling objects reach a "constant velocity" due to the restraining force of air. We call this restraining force "drag". This force caused by air resistance increases the faster the falling object fall until Terminal Velocity is reached.
    <h3>The Gravitational Explanation for Terminal Velocity</h3>
    <p>According to modern physics, the two forces acting upon a falling object are the gravitational force and the drag force. When an object reaches terminal velocity, it means that the gravity and drag forces are equal and in opposite directions.
    <div class="cited">
      <h3>The Drag Force is as Follows:</h3>
      <p><b style="text-align:center;">Fd=CApV2/2</b>
      <ul>
        <li>C - Drag coefficient dependent on geometry and surface finish
        <li>A - Reference Area of falling object (front facing area like the cone tip of a missile)
        <li>p  - density of air (lower at higher altitudes)
        <li>V - velocity (of the object through air)

    <h3>The Atmospheric Pressure of a Medium and The Acceleration of Falling Objects</h3>
    <p><span class="cited">The molecular density of the air through which an object is falling, has an influence on the amount of air friction that is present.</span>
    <span class="citation">[Note: <a href="https://www.quora.com/Does-the-amount-of-air-pressure-affect-how-fast-an-object-falls/answer/Ruan-Grootendorst">https://www.quora.com/Does-the-amount-of-air-pressure-affect-how-fast-an-object-falls/answer/Ruan-Grootendorst</a> <span>Same as above.</span>]</span>
    We can think of this molecular density, in part, as a function of Atmospheric Pressure. The higher the altitude, the less the atmospheric pressure. Atmospheric pressure literally decreases with increasing altitude. 
    <span class="cited">The pressure at any level in the atmosphere may be interpreted as the total weight of the air above a unit area at any elevation. At higher elevations, there are fewer air molecules above a given surface than a similar surface at lower levels. For example, there are fewer molecules above the 50 km surface than are found above the 12 km surface, which is why the pressure is less at 50 km.</span>

    However, determining the relationship between falling objects, atmospheric pressure, and molecular density is a bit more complicated.
    <h3>The Ideal Gas Law and its Relationship to Atmospheric Pressure and Atmospheric Density</h3>
    <p><span class="cited">The Ideal Gas Law, also called The General Gas Equation, is the Equation of State of a hypothetical ideal gas.</span>
      <span class="citation">[Note: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law</a> <span>Verbatim.</span>]</span>
      <span class="cited">In physics and thermodynamics, an Equation of State is a thermodynamic equation relating state variables which describe the state of matter under a given set of physical conditions, such as pressure, volume, temperature (PVT), or internal energy. Equations of State are useful in describing the properties of fluids, mixtures of fluids, and  solids.</span>
      <span class="citation">[Note: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_state">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_state</a> <span>Verbatim.</span>]</span>
    <div class="cited">
      <p>The Ideal Gas Law is a good approximation of the behavior of many gases under many conditions, although it has several limitations. It was first stated by Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron in 1834 as a combination of the empirical Boyle's law, Charles's law, Avogadro's law, and Gay-Lussac's law.
      <b>The Ideal Gas Law is often written in an empirical form:</b>
      <b style="text-align: center;">PV=nRT</b>
      <p>…where P, V and T are the pressure, volume and temperature; n is the amount of substance; and R is the ideal gas constant. It is the same for all gases. It can also be derived from the microscopic kinetic theory, as was achieved  by August Krönig in 1856 and Rudolf Clausius in 1857.

    </div>

    <div class="cited">
      <p>Air does not behave exactly like an Ideal Gas but the relationship is similar. Here we can see that if we can control the pressure exclusively, the density will be affected in the same way. Realistically, when the pressure is increased, the temperature will also increase but not quite enough to keep the density constant. Therefore it’s fair to say that with air, an increased pressure will result in an increased air density, which will then increase the drag force.
      <p>Perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous because it asks what the effect of air pressure is on a falling object’s velocity. We know that with a change in Pressure, there will also be a change in Temperature. If we want to know what the effect of exclusively changing the pressure is, we can look at an experiment inside a vacuum chamber:
      <ol>
        <li>If we have a feather inside a vacuum chamber at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, we then let the feather go and take the time it takes for the feather to drop.
        <li>We then reset the feather and activate the vacuum pump and allow the pressure to drop to half atmospheric pressure. We keep it at this pressure for a couple of minutes to allow the temperature inside the chamber to normalize back to room temperature. (now we have effectively changed only the air pressure)
        <li>If we now release the feather and clock the time it takes to drop, we find that the feather drops much faster.
        <li>The feather’s mass and geometry has remained the same but the effect of the lower air pressure has decreased the drag force.
        <li>By having a lower pressure at the same temperature, the density of the air has decreased and has therefore also decreased the drag force.
        <li>An increase of the pressure alone will also increase the drag force.
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="citation">

      <span>Again.</span>
    </div>
    <p>And so, we can see that it is not merely the atmospheric pressure that dictates the rate at which objects fall, but also we must factor in the molecular density and temperature of the pressurized medium in which they fall.
    
    <h3>We Live in an Enclosed Pressurized System According to The Second Law of Thermodynamics</h3>
    <div class="cited">
      <p>The second law of thermodynamics establishes the concept of entropy as a physical property of a thermodynamic system. Entropy predicts the direction of spontaneous processes, and determines whether they are irreversible or impossible despite obeying the requirement of conservation of energy as expressed in the first law of thermodynamics. The second law may be formulated by the observation that the entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease, as they always arrive at a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, where the entropy is highest.

    <p><span class="cited">In thermodynamics, a closed system can exchange energy (as heat or work) but not matter, with its surroundings. An isolated system cannot exchange any heat, work, or matter with the surroundings, while an open system can exchange energy and matter.</span> <span class="citation">[Note: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_system#In_thermodynamics">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_system#In_thermodynamics</a> <span>Verbatim.</span>]</span> If the earth was an open Thermodynamic system, the atmosphere would leach out into space in seconds, due to the immense theoretical vacuum of fictional Outer Space, and kill all life on Earth.
    <p>Thus, we know that we live in an enclosed pressurized system according to The Second Law of Thermodynamics.

    <h3>Examples of Open, Closed, and a Fully Enclosed Systems</h3>
    <div class="cited">
      <p><b>Open System:</b> An open system is a system that freely exchanges energy and matter with its surroundings. For instance, when you are boiling soup in an open saucepan on a stove, energy and matter are being transferred to the surroundings through steam.
      <p><b>Closed System:</b> Putting a lid on the saucepan makes the saucepan a closed system. A closed system is a system that exchanges only energy with its surroundings, not matter. By putting a lid on the saucepan, matter can no longer transfer because the lid prevents matter from entering the saucepan and leaving the saucepan.

    <h2>Free Fall and the Misleading Terminology of "Acceleration of Gravity": Elephants and Mice</h2>
    <p><span class="cited">The acceleration of a falling object on Earth is 9.8 m/s/s. This value, known as "the acceleration of Gravity", is the same for all falling objects regardless of how long they have been falling, or whether they were initially dropped from rest or thrown up into the air.</span> <span class="citation">[Note: <a href="https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/1DKin/Lesson-5/The-Big-Misconception">https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/1DKin/Lesson-5/The-Big-Misconception</a> <span>Nearly verbatim.</span>]</span> Nevertheless this variable, 9.8 m/s/s, does not literally or actually describe gravitational acceleration, but rather, it merely describes the rate at which objects fall. Extrapolating that this descriptive variable is connected to Gravity was the masterstroke of deception by Alchemical Wizard and High Freemason, Sir Issac Newton, in order to bolster up a Heliocentric Model of The Cosmos, complete with a Big Bang, billions of years of Evolution, and the possibility of alien life.
    <p>And so, remember, as we move forward, that although Newton’s mathematical descriptions do apply to falling bodes because the math "works", this does not imply that the causal force behind Newton’s mathematics is necessarily Gravity.
    <p><b>In fact, more empirically speaking, objects fall or rise due to the relationship between:</b>
    <ol>
      <li>Object Density
      <li>The Index of Buoyancy of an Object
      <li>Dielectric Forces
      <li>Electromagnetic Forces
      <li>Aerodynamic Resistance
      <li>Thermodynamic Exchange
      <li>The Result of an Object in a Particular Atmospheric Medium
      <li>At no point is an imaginary attractive force emanating from the center of the Earth either necessary or beneficial for predicting or calculating Newtonian motion.
    </ol>
    <p>At no point is Gravity necessary nor advantageously mechanically descriptive in order to calculate and describe physical bodies in motion. Newton’s math describes physical behavior, not causal forces. All of Newton’s Laws of Motion, including the math behind them, work perfectly fine without complicating matters with the idea of a fictional force pulling objects towards the center of the Earth.
    <h3>Mass Versus Density</h3>
    <div class="cited"><p>The term, "mass" is used to mean the amount of matter contained in an object. Density alludes to the closeness of the atoms, in substance, (i.e. how tightly atoms are packed). Mass is the measure of the amount of inertia, which is the tendency of an object to continue in the state of rest or of uniform motion. Conversely, density is the degree of compactness.</div>

    <h3>Free-Fall: The Elephant and The Mouse</h3>
    <p>Given all this, a <div class="cited overlapping">questions often asked is:
      <p>"Doesn't a more massive object accelerate at a greater rate than a less massive object?"
      <p>Would not an elephant fall faster than a mouse due to its far larger mass?
      <p>This question is a reasonable inquiry that is probably based in part upon personal observations made of falling objects in the physical world. After all, nearly everyone has observed the difference in the rate of fall of a single piece of paper versus a whole textbook. The two objects clearly travel to the ground at different rates, with the more massive book falling faster.
      <p>But why?
      <p>The answer to our particular question, "Doesn't a more massive object, like an elephant, accelerate at a greater rate than a less massive object, like a mouse?", is absolutely not. That is, absolutely not if we are considering the specific type of falling motion known as Free-Fall. Free-Fall is the motion of objects that move under the sole influence of <span style="background-color: white; display: inline-block">alleged</span> Gravity, irrespective air resistance, as in a vacuum.

    More massive objects will fall even slower if there is an appreciable amount of air resistance present. But in a vacuum, a single piece of paper will fall at the same rate as a whole textbook, and an elephant will fall as fast as a mouse, due to the lack of atmospheric resistance for both objects.
    <div class="cited"><p>Hence, if Newton's Second Law were applied to the falling motion of an elephant and a mouse, and if a free-body diagram were constructed, then it would be seen that the 1000-kg baby elephant would experiences a greater force of Gravity than a mouse due to its larger mass. This greater force of Gravity would have a direct effect upon the elephant's acceleration. Thus, based on force alone, it might be thought that the 1000-kg baby elephant would accelerate faster. But acceleration depends upon two factors: force and mass. The 1000-kg baby elephant obviously has more mass (or inertia). This increased mass has an inverse effect upon the elephant's acceleration. And thus, the direct effect of greater force on the 1000-kg elephant is offset by the inverse effect of the greater mass of the 1000-kg elephant; and so each object accelerates at the same rate - approximately 9.8 m/s/s. The ratio of force to mass (Fnet/m) is the same for the elephant and the mouse under situations involving Free Fall.</div>

    <h3>Newton’s "Gravitational Acceleration of Gravity" is Misleading Terminology</h3>
    <div class="cited"><p>The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to force and inversely proportional to mass. Increasing force tends to increase acceleration while increasing mass tends to decrease acceleration. Thus, the greater force on more massive objects is offset by the inverse influence of greater mass. Subsequently, all objects free fall at the same rate of acceleration, regardless of their mass.</div>

    <p>In other words, <span class="cited">the acceleration of the object equals the gravitational acceleration <span class="uncited">of alleged Gravity, in terms of Newtonian Mechanics</span>. The mass, size, and shape of the object are not a factor in describing the motion of the object. So all objects, regardless of size or shape or weight, free fall with the same acceleration.</span> <span class="citation">[Note: <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/ffall.html">https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/ffall.html</a> <span>Verbatim but for "of alleged Gravity, in terms of Newtonian Mechanics".</span>]</span> And yet, again, Newton’s "gravitational acceleration" variable still only describes motion, but not the cause of it. Newton’s "gravitational acceleration" variable is an example of   misleading terminology, and one should be wary of its misapplication in the calculation of falling bodies.
    <p>In summary, using Newton’s equations are beneficial for describing physical motion, as well as quite accurate, but implying that a magical, unproven force called Gravity is behind these equations is an unnecessary and unscientific leap of religious faith into fictional pseudo-science.

    <h2>The Role of Relative Density and the Atmospheric Medium on Falling Bodies: Clouds, Oceans, and Apples</h2>
    <p>Why do clouds, with millions of tons of water vapor mass, hang effortlessly in the air, while tiny little, comparatively massless, apples plummet to the ground? And meanwhile, the oceans, with billions and billions of tons of water mass, stick to the surface of an imaginary ball spinning at 1000 mph. How does mass play a role in these apparent enigmas where massive bodies appear to either float or sink without rhyme or reason, while smaller massed objects virtually free fall? If mass was the reason behind falling or rising bodies, certainly the larger the mass of a body, the more assured it would be to fall, right? But, this is not the case. And, it seems rather counterintuitive when you consider how heavy things fall from your hand to the ground so easily, but then clouds, weighing millions of tons, remain suspended in air.
    <p>To solve this apparent riddle, we must figure out what force is holding heavy massed objects like clouds in the air to "defy Gravity", while comparatively massless apples fall to the ground, knowing that we cannot explain this apparent contradiction using mass.
    <p>Recall that this <span class="cited">situation is described by Newton's Second Law of Motion. According to NASA, this law states, "Force is equal to the change in momentum per change in time. For a constant mass, force equals mass times acceleration."</span> <span class="citation">[Note: <a href="https://www.livescience.com/46560-newton-second-law.html">https://www.livescience.com/46560-newton-second-law.html</a> <span>Verbatim. Second time he’s pasted this exact passage.</span>]</span> And so, we must always insert the variables, Force, Mass, and Acceleration into the equation, F=ma, in order to solve for such paradoxical behavior. At face value, clouds have a great mass, and so they should virtually free fall to the ground.
    <h3>Mystery Solved: The Hidden Variables of Density and the Atmospheric Medium</h3>
    <p>However, though <span class="cited">increasing force tends to increase the rate of acceleration, increasing mass tends to decrease acceleration. Thus, the greater force on more massive objects is offset by the inverse influence of greater mass. Subsequently, all objects free fall at the same rate of acceleration, regardless of their mass.</span> <span class="citation">[Note: <a href="https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/1DKin/Lesson-5/The-Big-Misconception">https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/1DKin/Lesson-5/The-Big-Misconception</a> <span>Nearly verbatim. Second time he’s pasted this exact passage.</span>]</span> In this case, the force acting upon the clouds is the atmospheric pressure. The atmospheric pressure of The Earth is acting upon the greater mass of the water vapor, resulting in clouds that float instead of fall. You could look at atmospheric pressure as a force of resistance acting upon the clouds.

    <h3>Bobbing for Apples: Density and Buoyancy</h3>
    <p>Apples, on the other hand, are very small and so their relatively small mass is not influenced nearly as dramatically by the atmospheric medium it is falling within. Change the atmospheric medium to water, and the apple will float. It’s that simple. Gravity never comes into play. Far more can be explained by object density, and the relationship between any given object and the atmospheric medium it is acting within, than object mass and Gravity. Naturally, I am referring to the relationship between density and buoyancy, and how the atmospheric medium tends to dictate motion, whether up or down.
    <h3>The Mass Versus Density of Clouds and Apples</h3>
    <p>Recall that <span class="cited">the term, "mass" is used to mean the amount of matter contained in an object. Density alludes to the closeness of the atoms, in substance, (i.e. how tightly atoms are packed). Mass is the measure of the amount of inertia, which is the tendency of an object to continue in the state of rest or of uniform motion. Conversely, density is the degree of compactness.</span> <span class="citation">[Note: <a href="https://keydifferences.com/difference-between-mass-and-density.html#keyd">https://keydifferences.com/difference-between-mass-and-density.html#keyd</a> <span>Verbatim. Second time he’s pasted this exact yadda yadda yadda.</span>]</span>
    <p>And so, in the situation where clouds are far more massive than apples, with more weight in kilograms, they do not possess much atomic density due to the nature of water vapor. And this is why clouds are said to "defy Gravity" and stay aloft. It is their relatively sparse atomic density, compared to the meaty flesh of an apple. It is the atmospheric pressure above The Earth that holds millions of pounds of massive clouds in midair. Afterall, more massive objects will fall even slower if there is an appreciable amount of air resistance present acting as a Newtonian "Force" upon an object.

    <h3>The Relative Density of the Oceans Do Not Require Gravity to Lay Flat</h3>
    <div class="cited">
      <p>Relative density is the ratio of the density (mass of a unit volume) of a substance to the density of a given reference material. Specific gravity usually means relative density with respect to water. The term "relative density" is often preferred in scientific usage. It is defined as a ratio of density of particular substance with that of water.
      <p>If a substance's relative density is less than one, then it is less dense than the reference; if greater than 1 then it is denser than the reference. If the relative density is exactly 1 then the densities are equal; that is, equal volumes of the two substances have the same mass. If the reference material is water, then a substance with a relative density (or specific gravity) less than 1 will float in water. For example, an ice cube, with a relative density of about 0.91, will float. A substance with a relative density greater than 1 will sink.

    <p>But, Gravity has nothing to do with this situation. It is literally the relative density of objects, and their relative index of buoyancy in a particular medium that dictates all this vertical motion. The oceans stick to the ground because of their relative density, and not because of any imaginary force pulling them towards the center of an imaginary ball Earth.
